Game Server Structure
===================================================================

1) Master Server, port: 9099
	- Keep all active connections
	- Distribute connections among other child-pooled servers

	Responsibility:
	- Maintain list of games
	- Maintain list of players
	- Maintain list of host servers

2) Host Servers
	Responsibility:
	- Maintain list of game servers (used to host game tables)
	- Request game list from master server on an interval
	- Distribute list of games to players connected to the server upon request
	- Maintain player connections

3) Game Servers (aka: table/dealer servers)
	Responsibility:
	- Maintain each table game and players connection
	- Report game status to master server (completed | abandoned | etc)
	- Open / close games upon request from host server
	- Verify player by communication with master server via player guid key
	- Viewed games (all players on table + guests) are served from this server

4) All servers
	Responsibility:
	- Address all connections, games, players to file in case a reboot is required
	- Upon reboot, restart all games, wait for players connection, resume all game
	- Server is expected to lose players connection due to volatile connections
	- A server reboot treats all players as disconnected and resume games as if they player themselves were disconnected 

Note)
	- No automatic scaling, servers are preset with max games/connections
	- Once max games or connections are reached, users will be alerted to wait
	- Admin must spin up new servers and start game to accommodate players as necessary
